clear: clears

set R C N [RED|BLUE]: R: a row 1 - board size
                      C: a col 1 - board size
                      N: spots

eg 1 2


that's right, there's no way to examine the board state! jump61 is an
exercise in mental spot jumping. I hope you have a sharp memory. The
real game is how many times you need to call dump to win
